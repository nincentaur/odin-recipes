# odin-recipes
This project is to put the HTML info I've recently acquired/reviewed into practice.
I used relative links in the index page as well as an unordered list so the desserts are not displayed on a single line. For the recipes, I added width in the image tag to fix image size. This was not taught by Odin, but it was easy to figure out with the help of Google. I also used different header types and lists to make the recipe pages more legible and aesthetically pleasing.
For this project, I chose 3 of my most favorite desserts EVER. Many thanks to the brilliant bakers that put these recipes together.
