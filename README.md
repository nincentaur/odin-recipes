# odin-recipes
Purpose of this project is to put the HTML and CSS info I've recently acquired/reviewed into practice.
For content filler, I chose 3 of my most favorite desserts EVER, and one of my favorite memes. That possum is truly the embodiment of yolo. Kindly note that recipes and images used are not my own. Many thanks to the brilliant bakers that created these recipes and the photogs that took such delectable pictures.  
1st Round: I used relative links in the index page as well as an unordered list so the desserts are not displayed on a single line. For the recipes, I added width in the image tag to fix image size. This was not taught by Odin, but it was easy to figure out with the help of outside sources. I also used different header types and lists to make the recipe pages more legible and aesthetically pleasing.  
2nd Go: I used CSS for things I though I needed to include on the html page such as width so I fixed that. My ambition is always one or two steps ahead of the curriculum lol. In hindsight, I realized Odin would cover blocking, FLEXBOX, etc after revision assigment. Meanwhile, past-me wanted my pecipe pages to look a certain way so I barreled through it with the use of Google. It could definitely use some clean-up to get similar, if not better, results, but it turned out to be not bad. In fact, it, dare I say.. looks pretty good?
