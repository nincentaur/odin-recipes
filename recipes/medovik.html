  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <h4>For the Burnt Honey:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>3/4 cup wildflower honey</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons cold water</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>For the Cake Layers:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>14 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into slices</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup wildflower honey</li>
    <li>6 large cold eggs</li>
    <li>2 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon fine salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>3 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>For the Frosting:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>4 cups cold heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>3/4 cup sour cream</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Pour honey into a deep saucepan over medium heat. Boil until a shade darker and caramel-like in aroma, about 10 minutes. Turn off heat and whisk in cold water.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat (such as Silpat®). Place a mixing bowl and a whisk in the refrigerator.</li>
    <li>Place a large metal bowl over the lowest heat setting on the stovetop. Add butter, sugar, 1/4 cup of the burnt honey, and regular wildflower honey. Let sit until butter melts, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, combine baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a small bowl.</li>
    <li>Whisk butter mixture and let sit until very warm to the touch. Whisk in eggs. Keep mixture over low heat until it gets very warm again; whisk in baking soda mixture. Remove from heat. Sift in flour in 2 or 3 additions, stirring well after each, until batter is easily spreadable.</li>
    <li>Transfer about 1/2 cup batter onto the prepared baking sheet. Spread into an 8- or 9-inch circle using an offset spatula. Shake and tap the pan to knock out any air bubbles.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove liner from the pan and let cake layer continue cooling until firm enough to remove, 6 to 7 minutes. Invert cake onto a round of parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Repeat until you have a total of 8 cake layers, letting each cool on an individual parchment round. Trim edges using a pizza wheel to ensure they are the same size; save scraps for crumb mixture.</li>
    <li>Spread remaining batter onto the lined baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are dry, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and cut into small pieces; toss with reserved cake scraps.</li>
    <li>Return to the oven and continue to bake until browned, 7 to 10 minutes more. Let cool completely, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a resealable bag and beat into fairly fine crumbs using a rolling pin. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Remove the bowl and whisk from the refrigerator. Pour in heavy cream. Whisk until soft peaks form. Add remaining burnt honey and sour cream; continue whisking until stiff peaks form.</li>
    <li>Place a cake layer on a parchment paper round on top of a pizza pan or serving plate. Spread a cup of frosting evenly on top, almost to the edge. Repeat with cake layers and frosting, pressing the layers in smooth-side down. Place last cake layer smooth-side up. Frost the top and sides of the cake. Cover with crumbs; clean any excess crumbs around base.</li>
    <li>Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 8 hours, to overnight. Transfer to a cake stand using 2 spatulas. Cut and serve.</li>
