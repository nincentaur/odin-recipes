  <h3><p>Even though I'm not a fan of the summer heat, eating a fresh peach cobbler is a very valid reason to look forward to the sunny season regardless. Not only is cobbler easy to make, you can whip up your own ice cream as the perfect complement!</p>
  <p>This recipe will need about 30 minutes for prep time, 1hr 10 minutes for baking, and a minimum of 8 hours of refrigeration. It yields 1 9x13-inch cobbler.</p></h3>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <h4>Ice Cream:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>12 large egg yolks</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups white sugar</li>
    <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla bean paste</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Cobbler:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>2 pounds fresh peaches</li>
    <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon almond extract</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Whisk egg yolks and 1/4 cup sugar in a large bowl. Stir cream and remaining sugar together in a saucepan over low heat; bring to a simmer, about 12 minutes. Remove from heat. Slowly pour cream mixture into egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly.</li>
    <li>Return mixture to the saucepan; cook over low heat, whisking constantly, until thickened and bubbly. Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, then whisk in buttermilk, vanilla, and salt. Let cool completely, at least 30 minutes. Chill at least 4 hours or up to overnight.</li>
    <li>Pour mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions, about 20 minutes. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for the cobbler.</li>
    <li>Wash the fuzz off of the peaches and cut into wedges. Toss peach wedges with 1/2 cup sugar.</li>
    <li>Place butter in the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish and melt it in the oven, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, mix together flour, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, salt, and cinnamon. Stir in half-and-half, vanilla, and almond extract to form a loose batter; pour into baking dish over melted butter. Do not stir. Spoon peaches evenly over batter, without stirring.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and peaches are tender, 45 to 50 minutes. Serve warm with ice cream.</li>
